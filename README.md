# Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page

**User story #1**: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

**User story #2**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

**User story #3**: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

**User story #4**: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

**User story #5**: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

**User story #6**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

**User story #7**: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.

**User story #8**: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
